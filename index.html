				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>Kohikohi is an AR collecting game in which the user is encouraged to go out and check out local tracks around New Zealand. In this app users can explore and learn about local tracks as they are encouraged to collect 3D animated figures which they can use to build their virtual camp. Kohikohi was built with the idea of taking "nothing but memories, leave nothing but footprints". In the app collectible figures can be collected and traded in player hot spots, which normally would be located in the summit of the track or often in a stopover. Hence people can share parts of memories (collected figures) which can be found from different tracks around New Zealand.

	 			Apart from collectible figures, Kohikohi can also track user progress, track distance and the ideal time to complete the track. The app also has an inbuilt map and can detect where the user is on the track. The user is traced by Bluetooth beacons found along the track.

				Kohikohi also has a competitive aspect as a player can gain stickers after completing a task. Such as traveling a certain distance or completing a certain track. In the app, the users can also view other people's profile in which they can compare their achievements.</p>

				<h3>GPS for detection</h3>
				<p>Since the majority of the tracks will not have any signals the app will need a way to locate the user's location. Bluethooth becons would require wifi signals so i've desided to makeana app that uses geolocation and can be both used offline.A GPS works by detecting the user location through sending signals in space satelites.  

				Kohikohi is designed to trigger hotspots through GPS, while its offline. There are three types of Kohikohi hotspots, the first type is the pāpori which are located in the summit of the track or popular stops in the track, such as an overlooking area. App users can use pāpori hotspots to trade collectibles, where users can leave unwanted collectibles or collect unwanted collectibles. Then there's the second type of hotspots called kite. These hotspots are located all over the track. They are responsible for giving information where the user is. They are also responsible of giving rewards to the user. </p>
